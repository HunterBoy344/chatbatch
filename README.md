# chatbatch

(THIS IS AN OLD REPOSITORY, KEPT AROUND FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES)

(USE CHATBATCH EMBEDDED IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WORKS WELL)

A chat coded in batch for network drives. Now supports Drive File Stream/Google Drive for Desktop (only for G Suite/Google Workspace accounts) and choosing any drive and folder you want.

Works with any already letter-assigned file server for chatting. Additionally, it supports Google Drive for Desktop, which must be installed for the feature to work.

Note (for legacy Network Drive mode): Puts the chat directory in the root folder of the selected drive. The chat name is the name of the folder.
